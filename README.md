  # Quiz Quest
## Digital Technologies & Hangarau Matihiko Level 1

**Standard title**: Develop a computer program

**Credits**: 4

**Resource title**: Quiz Quest

**Resource reference**: Digital Technologies & Hangarau Matihiko 1.7A Version 2

### Introduction/Kupu Aratak
This assessment activity requires you to create a quiz program in a programming language and include questions on a topic of your choice. You are going to be assessed on how well you structure and refine your program.  A well-structured, refined program will have code that is easy to follow, update and maintain, and is free from bugs. You may work with others while discussing potential problem solutions or generating your questions, but all of your program must be entirely constructed and written by you.

## Task/Hei Mahi
Decide on the purpose for your quiz. For example,a quiz to help the user to study the road code or a study aid for an upcoming exam in another subject or a quiz to help your classmates learn Te Reo. 
Decide on the style of quiz that you will make, keeping in mind the time you have available, your programming ability and the software and hardware resources available to you. 
Examples of quiz styles are listed below:
- A multiple choice quiz
- A word answer quiz
- A timed quiz
- A multi-player quiz
- A game format quiz
- Any other style of quiz.
Your quiz must allow for user input in some form.

**You need to think about**:
- *How your quiz begins.* For example, should you have many levels? Is your quiz only appropriate for a certain age range?
- *How to store your data*. What variables will you require and what type of data will your variables store (e.g.text, numeric, Boolean).  Will you store data in collections (e.g.lists, arrays or dictionaries) to improve the structure, flexibility and robustness of your program?
- *How to structure your program*. What procedural structure will your program require? Will you create functions/method/procedures to improve the structure, flexibility and robustness of your program?
- *How you will give feedback to the user*.This could be in the form of a text prompt, a correct answer should the user answer incorrectly, a score that tracks user progress or any other method that you see fit to use. Also consider if you want to give immediate feedback, or only after quiz is complete.

**You must**:
- Create this quiz in an iterative manner. For example, break down the program into smaller achievable parts then code, test, debug and evaluate each part before moving on the next progressive improvement. It is advisable to save each version of the code as you make progress.

**Note**:To test a program in a comprehensive way, you should think about how you will test the program for various cases such as expected, boundary and unexpected input, what happens when lives run out or when a sprite gets to the border of the window. It is often useful to note down what you want to test and what you expect to happen, as well as what actually happened.
- Ensure that you comment your code appropriately as you develop it and use variable names and comments that describe code function and behaviour.
- Ensure that you have followed conventions for the programming language of your choice and that you have chosen a well-structured, logical response to the task. 
- You should ensure that your code is robust and that it handles expected, boundary and invalid values.
- Wherever possible you should try to ensure that your code has a flexible structure to allow for continued development.  

**Note**: Your quiz program must include variables of at least two different types, and sequence, selection, and iteration control structures. The program must also include one or more of: data stored in collections (e.g. at least 2 lists, arrays, dictionaries); OR at least 2 user-defined methods, functions or procedures.
